# fun-stuff

Hey all,
I made this code to run a pair of featherwing dotstars from adafruit. I used their code as inspiration, some pieces I copied and then changed, other parts might remain unchanged, I wasn't keeping track on what came from what. I used google and searched for a few helper ideas with the millis() features that I ended up not implementing.  

This is my first time posting to github so any tips there are also appreciated.
